## What is LIMES?

LIMES is a link discovery framework for the Web of Data. It implements time-efficient approaches for large-scale link discovery based on the characteristics of metric spaces. 

## Problems with JavaFX?
While Oracle Java 8 should have JavaFX included, with OpenJDK for Java 8 it depends whether the package assembler choose to 
include JavaFX. And in [some cases](https://github.com/AKSW/LIMES-dev/issues/56) it can happen, that neither works. 
First thing you should do is check if you can find `jfxrt.jar`, it *should* be in `<JRE_HOME>/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar` (but in this
case everything should be working just fine). If you find it somewhere else, you have to put it on the classpath. A guide
on how to do this can be found [here](http://askubuntu.com/a/609954). If this does not work, trying to reinstall java would be a good
idea (if you've used OpenJDK before try Oracle Java!).

If this doesn't work, in Ubuntu versions 15.04 upwards you can install JavaFX seperately using `sudo apt-get install openjfx`.
Unfortunately this package seems unavailable for lower Ubuntu versions (Although there is always the possibility to 
[build it yourself](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX/Building+OpenJFX) or use [community builds](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX/Community+Builds)).
