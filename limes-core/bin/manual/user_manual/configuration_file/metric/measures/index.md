# Measure Packages

Measures are organized in packages, based on the type of resource they are designed to operate with. 
Several measure packages ship with LIMES and it is easy to extend it with your own.

The current version of LIMES ships with the following measure packages included:

* string
* vector space
* pointset
* topological
* temporal
* resource set

More complex distance measures are being added continuously.
